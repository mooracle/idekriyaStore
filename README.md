**README: IDEKRIYA STORE PROJECT**

This is my private project of making Java based website that main objective is to build an online store. However, the
development of the web app will be done in stages. The first stage will serves the displaying aspect of merchandises.

The documentation will be placed in: 

**PS:**
The initial commit still has Controller and Color to be left behind since this is the part where we only focus on 
basic functions and components of a online Store.

NOTE: WE NEED TO GO BACK HERE FOR CONTROLLERS SETTING LATER!

Next: we will jump first into JPA annotations for both entities (Merchandise and Category) before considering other
entity which is a transaction

This initial commit in the GitHub focus on the build.gradle and README.md file. Both files are succesfully built and 
then commited.
